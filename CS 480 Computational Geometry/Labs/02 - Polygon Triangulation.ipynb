Each handler function should have two parameters `x` and `y` for the coordinates of the mouse pointer at the time the event fired. \n",

The basic idea is to package up the drawing commands into a `draw()` function that first clears the canvas, and then draws the main scene. A global variable `mouseDown` tracks whether the mouse is currently up or down. In this dummy example, the color of the square changes depending on whether the mouse is up, down, or down and moving so that you can see how the interaction events are fired. The current color is stored in a global variable `squareColor` which is modified by the mouse handler functions `handle_mouse_down`, `handle_mouse_up`, and `handle_mouse_move`. \n"

    "# Storing a polygon\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two natural ways to store a polygon. One is to store the vertices in order (generally counter-clockwise) in an array-based list. This is useful for applications where random access to the polygon's vertices is needed, but makes certain operations, like splitting a polygon along a diagonal more cumbersome. A second method is to store the polygon vertices as a doubly linked list. To do this we will define a container called a `Polygon` that keeps track of its `firstVertex`. Each vertex will be stored in a `Vertex` object that stores both its 2D point location (as a `PointE2` object accessible via the `.pos` attribute) and references to the previous (`.prev`) and next (`.next`) vertices in the polygon."
