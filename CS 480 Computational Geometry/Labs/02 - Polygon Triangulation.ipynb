Each handler function should have two parameters `x` and `y` for the coordinates of the mouse pointer at the time the event fired. \n",

    "A quick and dirty architecture for basic user interaction with a canvas follows. The basic idea is to package up the drawing commands into a `draw()` function that first clears the canvas, and then draws the main scene. A global variable `mouseDown` tracks whether the mouse is currently up or down. In this dummy example, the color of the square changes depending on whether the mouse is up, down, or down and moving so that you can see how the interaction events are fired. The current color is stored in a global variable `squareColor` which is modified by the mouse handler functions `handle_mouse_down`, `handle_mouse_up`, and `handle_mouse_move`. \n"
