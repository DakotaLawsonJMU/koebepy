    "1. Execute the code below. Notice that in addition to an editable polygon, you also get a blue button that currently says \"Edit\". If you click this button it will cycle through \"Edit\", \"Median\", and \"Discrete flow\" modes. Edit mode allows you to edit the vertices of the polygon. The median and discretre flow modes will execute your smoothing functions once you have implemented them. In either median or discrete flow mode clicking anywhere on the polygon will execute one smoothing step. I have implemented a simple scaling function to show you how this works (`median_smooth` will shrink and `discreteflow_smooth` will grow the polygon). \n",
    "2. Replace my dummy implementation of `median_smooth` with an implementation of the algorithm as described in section 5.5. Recall that the median of a line segment from $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$ is $(\\frac{x_0 + x_1}{2}, \\frac{y_0 + y_1}{2})$. \n",

To do this, you need to implement the `perimeter`, `centroid`, and `scale_to_length` functions below. Change the call to `CurveShorteningCanvas` so that `scaling = True` to see the result of your work. \n",
