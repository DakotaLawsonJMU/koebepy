The choice is somewhat arbitrary, but Python is a highly expressive language (meaning that we can accomplish complex coding tasks without a lot of code), is an industry standard (it is the 3rd most popular language on the TIOBE index as of Dec. 2019), and Python is the default kernel for Jupyter notebooks (the programming environment you are using now) which allows for the creation of highly interactive tutorials like this one. \n",
